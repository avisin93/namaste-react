*****Yes, that's right, parsing basically means "reading the code" and executing basically means "running the code".*****

Ans8. async , defer jaan ne se pehle 
      a)html parsing aise hoti hai ki pehle html load hui jaise hi script tag mila vaha ruk gayi html parsing and script tag ko pehle load kiya fir usse execute kiya fir html parsing continue kari
      b) using async attribute :
      html parsing huyi saath hi parallel mai script load kardi fir script execute huyi uske baad html parsing continue kari
      c) defer attribute is best why?
      html parsing ke time parallel mai script load huyi and html parsing continues and at last script execute huyi.

      question arise why script executes first and even html keeps on parsing? do google
